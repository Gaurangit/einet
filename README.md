# Effective information and causal emergence in networks

Python code for calculating *effective information* in networks. This can then be used to search for macroscale representations of a network such that the coarse grained representation has more effective information than the microscale, a phenomenon known as *causal emergence*.

This code accompanies the recent paper:
